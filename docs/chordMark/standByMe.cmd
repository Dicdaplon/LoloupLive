[Intro]
| G | Em | C | D |

[Verse 1]
G           Em
When the night has come
C                 D
And the land is dark
G               Em
And the moon is the only
C                 D
Light we'll see

[Chorus]
G           Em
So darling, darling stand by me
C           D
Oh stand by me
G           Em
Oh stand, stand by me
C       D      G
Stand by me

[Bridge]
| Em | C | G | D |
| Em | C | G | D |

[Verse 2]
G                Em
If the sky that we look upon
C                     D
Should tumble and fall
G               Em
Or the mountains should crumble
C             D
To the sea

[Chorus]
G           Em
I won't cry, I won't cry
C             D
No I won't shed a tear
G             Em
Just as long as you stand
C       D       G
Stand by me
